Long before class:

 + Update the scheduling spreadsheet with links to these files (and others)
 + Run spreadsheet-to-rst.py to generate pretty .rst table for schedule.

Right before class:
 + Run polly_generator.py to pre-generate any quizzes for posting in slack.
 + Run assign_groups.py to assign students into breakout rooms.

After class:
 + Process the video and post it to youtube.
 + Export the slack session to a zip file.
 + Export the notebook to html using nbconvert
 + Update the class-schedule spreadsheet with the new links.
 + Run session_to_html.py to convert the zip file, youtube link, and content
   links into html.
 + Update the docs/ folder and commit to github.
