<p>All lecture materials and homework will be distributed through a Jupyterhub hosted
here on campus. To access these assignments, open a browser (Google Chrome, Safari,
or Firefox, not Internet Explorer) and go to:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://aclarke.uoregon.edu:8000">https://aclarke.uoregon.edu:8000</a></p>
<p>You may get a warning about security. Don’t panic, the page is secure. If that happens,
click the “Advanced” link, and you’ll get a new link that says “Process to aclark.uoregon.edu (unsafe)”.
Click that link as well and you’ll arrive at this page:</p>

<div class="section" id="fetching-assignments">
<h2>Fetching assignments<a class="headerlink" href="#fetching-assignments" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When we release a new assignment or lecture folder, you will need to <em>fetch</em> it
through the Jupyterhub. Login and you will see your personal Jupyter dashboard.</p>
<img alt="_images/jh-dashboard.png" class="align-center" src="_images/jh-dashboard.png" />
<p>At the top of the dashboard, click on the <strong>Assignments</strong> tab. This will display
three panels: <em>Released assignments</em>, <em>Downloaded Assignments</em>, and <em>Submitted
Assignments</em>.</p>
<img alt="_images/jh-released.png" class="align-center" src="_images/jh-released.png" />
<p>The <em>Released assignments</em> panel lists lecture materials and homeworks
that are available to download. You can acquire an item from this list by clicking the <strong>Fetch</strong>
button. The item will move into the <em>Downloaded assignments</em>
panel.</p>
<img alt="_images/jh-downloaded.png" class="align-center" src="_images/jh-downloaded.png" />
<p>Click on the <strong>Files</strong> tab at the top of the page, and you’ll see the items in your
dashboard. Now you can open the items you snatched from us, but <strong>DO NOT</strong> run the
notebooks on the server.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>You can always re-fetch assignments if something goes wrong. Just <strong>Delete</strong>
(or rename) the bad folder from your dashboard, and it will reappear in the
<em>Released Assignments</em> tab. You can click <strong>Fetch</strong> again and get a fresh copy.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="downloading-assignments-locally">
<h2>Downloading assignments locally<a class="headerlink" href="#downloading-assignments-locally" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Fetching items <em>does not</em> download them to your computer. They are still on the server.
To download a notebook to your computer, check the box to the left of it and click <strong>Download</strong>.
Unfortunately, Jupyterhub only allows you to download a
single notebook at a time, so you’ll need to do this for each notebook.</p>
<img alt="_images/jh-download.png" class="align-center" src="_images/jh-download.png" />
<p>This will likely download to your <em>Downloads</em> folder on your computer. You can
move them to whatever folder you use for this class and launch Jupyter to run them.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Any changes you make to the notebook on your local computer won’t be saved on the server.
This is a local copy that you can freely change. If you want to start with a fresh
copy, just re-download the notebook from JupyterHub.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="submitting-homework">
<h2>Submitting Homework<a class="headerlink" href="#submitting-homework" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To submit a homework assignment that you’ve downloaded and worked on locally
(on your computer), you must upload it back to Jupyterhub and <strong>replace</strong> the original
file in its original location with your new file.</p>
<p>Login to Jupyterhub and navigate to the folder that contains the original notebook.
Check the box next to the notebook, click the trash button, and delete.</p>
<img alt="_images/jh-delete.png" class="align-center" src="_images/jh-delete.png" />
<img alt="_images/jh-delete-2.png" class="align-center" src="_images/jh-delete-2.png" />
<p>Next, click <strong>Upload</strong> in the upper right corner of the dashboard and upload your
notebook to the server. You’ll need to confirm the upload by clicking the <strong>Upload</strong>
button next to the notebook in the dashboard</p>
<img alt="_images/jh-upload.png" class="align-center" src="_images/jh-upload.png" />
<p>Once the file is uploaded, click on the <em>Assignments</em> tab at the top of the dashboard.
Find the homework assignment in the <em>Downloaded Assignments</em> panel and click <strong>Submit</strong>.</p>
<img alt="_images/jh-submit.png" class="align-center" src="_images/jh-submit.png" />
<p>The submitted assignment will show up in the <em>Submitted assignments</em> panel with
a timestamp printed to the right. We will collect assignments on their due date.
Any assignment not submitted through the Jupyterhub by the due date will not be
collected for grading.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>You can submit an assignment multiple times and we will always collect
the most recent version. No other students will
be able to see your submissions.</p>
