Assignments
-----------

*All assignments should be turned in on canvas.  Assignments are due by 9 am

Final project

Weekly assignments
..................

+ There will be 8 labs.
+ We will (generally) start the labs on Fri in class.
+ They will (usually) be due the following Wed in class.
+ Please compress the entire folder containing your jupyter notebook and
  associated input files.  This will make sure we can run the notebook when
  grading.
+ Labs will be graded based on whether they are turned in, whether we can run
  the notebook, and whether they notebooks give the right results.
+ Group work on the labs is encouraged, but please do not :code:`copy-paste`
  code.

+ The points posted on Canvas are the *offical* point totals.  If you think
  there has been a mistake with your points, please contact me.
+ Anyone receiving 90% or more of the points will receive an A, 80%-90% a B, etc.
  I may curve the course, but this will only improve your grade from the
