Remote work
===========

Because of the COVID-19 situation, the entire course will be done remotely.
I have not done this before, so bear with me while I figure it out.  Constructive
feedback is encouraged!

Class time
----------
+ The class is scheduled to start at 9:00 am, MWF.  I will start a zoom meeting
  around 8:50 am each day.  I will post the link in the slack :code:`#general`
  channel.
+ *Please mute your microphone unless you are speaking*
+ **Breakout Rooms**: We will make liberal use of breakout rooms during class.
  Be prepared to work in assigned pairs and small groups during class.

  * **Please reserve the** :code:`#in_class` **channel for discussions of class
    material.** If something wacky is going on (you’re in a breakout room alone,
    you just got kicked off of zoom, jupyter suddenly stopped working etc.),
    please post this on :code:`#help.`   We’ll monitor this as well and can chat
    with you there.

  * **When we start a breakout session, we will post a message on** :code:`#in_class`
    **that says “WE NEED A TA!”**  While you’re in your breakout room, you can reply
    to the “WE NEED A TA” message to get help.  Include your breakout room name
    in the message.  (The breakout room name will be in the title bar of your
    main zoom window).  We’ll react with a thumbs up and someone in as soon as
    we can.

  * **When there are a couple minutes left in the breakout session, we will post
    three interactive messages:**

    + POINTS FOR DISCUSSION: Reply to this message with questions or thoughts
      you’d like to discuss in the main session. Emoji reactions on others’
      questions help us judge which questions are most important to address as
      a whole group.

    + SOMETHING I LEARNED: Reply to this message with something(s) you learned
      during the breakout session that you did not know previously.  Again, feel
      free to react to others.

    + ASSESSMENT POLL: Answer the poll so we can get a feel for overall
      understanding of the material.

+ If you have a question during the in-class discussion, you can
  `Raise your blue hand <https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/205566129-Raise-Hand-In-Webinar>`_


Material
--------
+ The material for each week will be posted on the `main page <index.html>`_
  prior to the week's class.

+ After each class session, I will post:

    * Video of the zoom session
    * Text of the :code:`#in_class` chat log
    * Any slides or notebooks I put up on the screen in class

+ Homework will be submitted via `canvas <canvas.uoregon.edu>`_.

Slack
-----
Slack is going to be the primary means of communication in this class.  You
should have gotten an invitation to the slack organization for the class.
If not, please email me.

Direct messages
...............

+ I prefer slack to email; this is the best way to reach me for class business.
+ For content questions, please post on :code:`#help` rather than sending a
  direct message so others can see.

Channels
........

+ :code:`#general`:

    * I'll post announcements here.
    * I'll post zoom links to class and office hours here.
    * Feel free to use this to organize study sessions, group work, etc.

+ :code:`#random`:

    * Fun stuff not directly related to the class.
    * Great for building community.
    * Remember to keep things respectful.

+ :code:`#in_class`:

    * This channel is for conversations, questions, and polls from class.
    * Post questions and thoughts about *course content* on this channel at any
      time during the class session itself.   (If you are having technical
      difficulties, please use :code:`#help` during class).
    * Reactions and replies to others' questions will be very helpful.
    * I will post the :code:`#in_class` log after each class.

+ :code:`#help`:

    * Use this any time throughout the week if you have questions on homework or
      content.
    * Before posting, check recent entries to see if someone has already posed
      the question.
    * Do *not* email the TAs or me with content questions; put them on the channel
      so everyone can see them.
    * Feel free to reply to others, comment, etc. on each thread.
    * *Use threads*


Recommendations
---------------
+ Get the `zoom <https://zoom.us/download>`_ and
  `slack <https://slack.com/downloads/>`_ desktop apps.
+ During class sessions, use slack on your phone or tablet to save screen space.
+ Make liberal use of the :code:`#help` slack channel.
+ Upload profile photos to slack and zoom so everyone has some idea of who they
  are talking to!
