# Scientific Computing

Repo holds the web page for a Scientific Computing course taught at the
University of Oregon.

This is an *implementation* of the material stored in the pythonic-science
repo.  

### Components

+ **docs/**: holds the html that is then hosted on github.io/scientific-computing
    + sphinx-generated documentation goes in the base directory
    + other content should be placed in non-sphinx to protect it from sphinx
      madness.
+ **source/**: holds the sphinx source
+ **tech/**: scripts for actually running the class.
