Remote work
===========

Because of the COVID-19 situation, the entire course will be done remotely.
I have not done this before, so bear with me while I figure it out.  Constructive
feedback is encouraged!

Class time
----------
+ The class is scheduled to start at 9:00 am, MWF.  I will start a zoom meeting
  around 8:50 am each day.  I will post the link in the slack :code:`#general`
  channel.
+ *Please mute your microphone unless you are speaking*
+ We will make liberal use of breakout rooms during class.  Be prepared to
  work in assigned pairs and small groups during class.
+ If you have questions and comments during class, please post them in the
  :code:`#in_class` channel.  The TAs and I will monitor this channel.  Depending
  on the situation, we may start a class discussion, join you in your breakout
  room or start a DM chat.

Slack
-----

Slack is going to be the primary means of communication in this class.  You
should have gotten an invitation to the slack organization for the class.
If not, please email me.

Direct messages
...............

+ I prefer slack to email; this is the best way to reach me for class business.
+ For content questions, please post on :code:`#help` rather than sending a
  direct message so others can see.

Channels
........

+ **#general**:
    * I'll post announcements here.
    * I'll post zoom links to class and office hours here.
    * Feel free to use this to organize study sessions, group work, etc.

+ **#random**:
    * Fun stuff not directly related to the class.
    * Great for building community.
    * Remember to keep things respectful.

+ **#in_class**:
    * This channel is for conversations, questions, and polls from class.
    * Post questions at any time during the class session itself.
    * Reactions and replies to others' questions will be very helpful.
    * I will post the :code:`#in_class` log after each class.

+ **#help**:
    * Use this any time throughout the week if you have questions on homework or
      content.
    * Before posting, check recent entries to see if someone has already posed
      the question.
    * Do *not* email the TAs or me with content questions; put them on the channel
      so everyone can see them.
    * Feel free to reply to others, comment, etc. on each thread.
    * *Use threads*

Material
--------
+ The material for each week will be posted on the `main page <index.html>`_
  prior to the week's class.
+ After each class session, I will post:
    * Video of the zoom session
    * Text of the :code:`#in_class` chat log
    * Any slides or notebooks I put up on the screen in class
+ Homework will be submitted via `cavnas <canvas.uoregon.edu>`_.


Recommendations
---------------

+ Get the `zoom <https://zoom.us/download>`_ and
  `slack <https://slack.com/downloads/>`_ desktop apps.
+ During class sessions, use slack on your phone or tablet to save screen space.
+ Make liberal use of the :code:`#help` slack channel.
