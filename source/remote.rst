Remote work
===========

Because of the COVID-19 situation, the entire course will be done remotely.
I have not done this before, so bear with me while I figure it out.  Constructive
feedback is encouraged!

Zoom
----

+ *Please mute your microphone unless you are speaking*
+ We will make liberal use of breakout rooms during class.  Be prepared to
  work in pairs and small groups during class.
+ I will record each zoom session and post it after class.

Slack

Direct messages
...............

+ I prefer slack to email; this is the best way to reach me.
+ For content questions, please post on :code:`help` rather than sending a
  direct message so others can see.


Channels
........

+ `#general`:
    + I'll post announcements here.
    + I'll post zoom links to class and office hours here.
    + Feel free to use this to organize study sessions, group work, etc.

+ `#random`:
    + Fun stuff not directly related to the class.
    + Great for building community.
    + Memes are great, but remember to keep things respectful.

+ :`#in_class`:
    + This channel is for conversations, questions, and polls from class.
    + Post questions at any time during the class session itself.
    + Reactions and replies to others' questions will be very helpful.
    + I will post the :code:`#in_class` log after each class.

+ `#help`:
    + Use this any time throughout the week if you have questions on homework or
      content.
    + Before posting, check recent entries to see if someone has already posed
      the question.
    + Do *not* email/DM Luis or me with content questions; put them on the channel
      so everyone can see them.
    + Feel free to reply to others, comment, etc. on each thread.
    + *Use threads*

Recommendations
---------------

+ Get the `zoom <https://zoom.us/download>`_ and
  `slack <https://slack.com/downloads/>`_ desktop apps.
+ During class sessions, use slack on your phone or tablet to save screen space.
+ Make liberal use of the :code:`\#help` slack channel.
